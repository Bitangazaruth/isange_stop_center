        <p className="mb-4">
          Gender-based violence (GBV) refers to harmful acts directed at an
          individual based on their gender. It is rooted in gender inequality,
          the abuse of power, and harmful norms. GBV can have physical, sexual,
          emotional, and economic impacts on individuals and communities. During
          the COVID-19 lockdowns, there was a significant increase in GBV
          incidents due to economic strain, social isolation, and deep-rooted
          patriarchal norms.
